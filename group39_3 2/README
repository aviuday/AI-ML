1. To run the code with your own Data, start with section 1, move on to 2 and 3

2. To split the existing data into training and test, and training the model using this data, follow from section 2, move on to 3.

3. To train the model using the existing split Training and Test Data, follow from section 3.

4. To load a pre trained model, and use it on Test Data, follow from section 4.


Section 1:
1. Make sure your Data has its images in different folders based on the True Labels of your images.
2. Just change the path in line 8 of project_detection.py to your new Data Folder.
2. Run project_detection.py

Section 2:
1. Make sure there are new empty folders for Train Set, and Test Set, which will be filled by the command.
2. Run project_datasplitting.py

Section 3:
1. Start reading project_recognition.ipynb, and running each command , till the end of the task at hand is, eg testing data accuracy.


Section 4:
1. Go down in project_recognition.ipynb, till we reach the section ,"Loading a saved model to use for testing purposes".
2. We will see the pkl load command, and we can run that command, to use any pre trained model for our network.
3. Following that, we can do a point wise test, or a test on the complete Test Data.
